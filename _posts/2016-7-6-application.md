You want to know a sure-fire way that I **won't** work for your company?

Make me go to a separate page, create and account, input all my information (including my resume), ask if want to receive news about your company, create a username and password, and then finally allow me to apply for your job.

Seriously, I'm not even going to put in an example in the post because the problem is incredibly ubiquitous

All you have to do is make it incredibly, nay, STUPIDLY simple to allow people to apply for jobs, otherwise they aren't going to think twice about working for you.

And don't give me this crap about weeding out those who aren't dedicated enough to go through the process.

Seriously, one page to input info and upload a resume and then a big fat button that says "APPLY FOR THIS JOB"

That's it.

Ok, I wrote this and now I'm adding an example. Found this one while applying for jobs, exactly what I'm talking about.
