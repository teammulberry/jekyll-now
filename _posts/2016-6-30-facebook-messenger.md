Frustrating as Facebook may be, we all use it for communicating and although they have pushed us toward using the messaging app, sometimes we are on a computer (novelty, I know).

Normally when someone is online, you get a green dot next to their name:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/001-1-facebook.png" alt="Green Dot" class="sm-img"/>

The same thing happens in a group message, there is a green dot when someone is online:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/001-2-facebook.png" alt="Facebook Problem" class="sm-img"/>

Problem is, you have no idea who it is that's online. A hover text will tell you who is in the group with you, but not who is currently residing in the conversation.

Facebook, please put a green dot next to the people who are online in a group convo:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/001-3-facebook.png" alt="Facebook fix" class="sm-img"/>
