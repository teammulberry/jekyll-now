title: First Pok√©mon Go sin

Ok, let's just start the article off by saying that Pok&#233;mon go is amazing. I love the game, the UI, the mechanics, it's just all around really, really well done.

There's one mechanic of the game that allows you to transfer your Pok&#233;mon back to the professor for candies that help you evolve said monsters.

When you open up the detail screen for one of your little monsters, this is what you see.

Now, I don't really think that below the fold exists in web design. However, I would say that it's prevalent pitfall in app design, if you don't see it, you might not know that you have to scroll.

The transfer button is located below the details of your Pok&#233;mon, underneath a map of where you caught it. The map also lags in loading, so you try to click the transfer button and then it pushes it down while you're trying to hit it.

About a week into playing the game, I didn't even know that you *could* transfer because it was so buried and unintuitive to find.

Moving this button somewhere else would be more efficient and less confusing as its a pretty critical aspect of the game.

Props to [this guy](https://dribbble.com/shots/2832639-Pokemon-Go-Transfer-Button) on Dribbble for thinking the same thing as me.

My cohort here at Team Mulberry also suggested that passcode protecting the transfer button might be useful in case your phone gets jacked or you accidentally hit that button.

Thanks for reading.
