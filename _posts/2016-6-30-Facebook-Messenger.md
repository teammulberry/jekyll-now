Frustrating as Facebook may be, we all use it for communicating and although they have pushed us toward using the messaging app, sometimes we are on a computer (novelty, I know). 
​
Normally when someone is online, you get a green dot next to their name:   
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Screen Shot 2016-06-30 at 9.52.11 AM.png" alt="Green Dot"/>   
​
The same thing happens in a group message, there is a green dot when someone is online:   
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Facebook Problem.png" alt="Facebook Problem"/>   
​
Problem is, you have no idea who it is that's online. A hover text will tell you who is in the group with you, but not who is currently residing in the conversation. 
​
Facebook, please put a green dot next to the people who are online in a group convo:   
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Facebook fix.png" alt="Facebook fix"/>
